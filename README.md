EMG Based Virtual Keyboard   
for developing Watchband-shaped IoT device input system   
  
         
## Method
```bash
(1) EMG data acquisition - OpenBCI 
(2) Pin Electrode - Self-manufactured Pin-header based Pins 
(3) Model - Convolutional Neural Network
```

## Result
* Offline Training & Test    
:: Classifying 4 gestures (exploting index/middle/ring finger buttons + 1 noise) with 2-channel

* Watchband Pilot Real-time Test
(Not very good performance, maybe by different sampling rate)   
(On Going, but stopped to serve military obligation...)
